                <section>
                    <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>The original cast had been playing a Pathfinder campaign for about two years before they converted their home game into a livestreamed series.
                        The campaign began as a one-off game organized for Liam's birthday. This one-off was played by Liam, Sam Riegel, Laura Bailey, Travis Willingham, Taliesing Jaffe and Orion Acaba, with Matthew Mercer as the DM.
                        Marisha Ray and Ashley Johnson joined the game in later sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2015, they were approached by Felicia Day to stream their campaign live on the Geek & Sundry twitch channel. In preparation for the streamed series,
                        Matt converted the game over from Pathfinder to Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
                    <p>The first campaign and a part of the second campaign were live streamed on the Geek & Sundry Twitch channel. The first campaign and a part of the second campaign were live streamed on the Geek & Sundry Twitch channel.
                        In February 2019, Critical Role parted ways with Geek & Sundry, launched their own Twitch and YouTube channels, and started to self-produce new shows and content under the name Critical Role Productions LLC.
